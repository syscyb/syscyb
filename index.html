  <h2 id="research">Systemic and Cybernetic Intelligence</h2>
  <p>My research explores the intersection of artificial and natural intelligence*, investigating how diverse forms of learning and adaptation can inform and enhance one another. By leveraging adaptive artificial systems and computational modeling, I formulate and test hypotheses about learning, evolution and adaptation of systems, drawing comparisons across artificial, biological/physical, and hybrid domains.</p>

  <p>In the realm of active matter, I study how intelligent agent-based simulations can replicate, approximate, or predict the emergent behaviors observed in physical systems. This work contributes to bridging the gap between artificial and natural intelligence, and extends toward developing automated tools for discovery, such as computer-aided hypothesis generation and experimental design.</p>

  <p>This integrative perspective also guides my work across various scientific and engineering disciplines. I focus on building simulators that learn from real-world data and become active components in the research cycle, incorporating causal knowledge, structured representations, and real-time inference during simulation and analysis. These tools aim to provide greater transparency and explainability in our understanding of complex systems.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I apply these principles to socio-economic systems, modeling organizations and markets as cybernetic agents capable of learning, adapting, and optimizing based on data-driven feedback loops.</p>

  <p>My overarching goal is to develop a unified framework in which artificial, biological, and physical systems are treated as part of a continuous spectrum, advancing our understanding of intelligence, adaptation, and emergent behaviors.</p>

  <h3>Current areas of interest and focus include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Machine learning</li>
    <li>Temporal networks</li>
    <li>Neuroengineering</li>
    <li>Computer-aided medical procedures</li>
    <li>Experimental physics</li>
    <li>Active matter</li>
    <li>(Evolutionary) robotics / neurorobotics</li>
    <li>Computational social science</li>
</ul>

    * This distinction between artificial and natural intelligence is ultimately unnecessary within this framework, as everything that exists is part of a natural process. However, it is retained here in the hope of supporting clarity for the reader.
